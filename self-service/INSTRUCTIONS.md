- Refresh the ORCL Dev container from “production” (orcl  dSource)

### Steps
1. Open a terminal session on the Delphix student lab desktop by double-clicking on the Terminal app on the desktop
1. Create a SSH connection to the *linuxsource* host as the delphix user by entering the following commands in the terminal window:
   - `ssh delphix@10.0.x.20`  (Replace x with your assigned student number)
   - Enter “Yes” if prompted to accept the SSH connection
   - Provide the delphix password: *delphix*
   - Enter the following commands at the UNIX command-line on *linuxsource*
   ```
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   
   CREATE TABLE sourcetab1 AS SELECT * FROM dba_objects;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sourcetab1;
   ```
1. Open a browser window on your Delphix student lab desktop and enter the IP address of your Delphix engine
1. Open the Delphix Engine, navigate to Manage > Datasets, select the orcl DSource and click on the Snapshot button
1. Login to the Self-Service interface
   - Username: *dev*
   - Password: *delphix*
1. You will be prompted to reset the dev user password
   - Enter *dev* as the new password
1. Create a SSH connection to the *linuxtarget* host as the delphix user by entering the following commands in the terminal window:
   - `ssh delphix@10.0.x.30`  (Replace x with your assigned student number)
   - Enter “Yes” if prompted to accept the SSH connection
   - Provide the delphix password: *delphix*
   - Enter the following commands on the *linuxtarget*
   ```
   export ORACLE_SID=devdb
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sourcetab1;
   ```
   Why did you get an error message stating “table or view does not exist”?
1. Switch back to the Delphix GUI in the browser showing the Self-Service interface, logged in as *dev*
1. Click on *ORCL Dev Container* and click **Refresh** option
1. After the Refresh operation completes, go back to the terminal window:
   - Exit from the SQL*Plus command if it is still connected
   - Enter the following commands on the *linuxtarget*
   ```
   sqlplus / as sysdba
   
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sourcetab1;
   ```
  Why did the `COUNT(*)` command work this time?
  Does the SOURCETAB1 table have the same number of rows as it had on the source database on the linuxsource server?
